# IALP2016_YNU_ISE_HPC
This repository is the codes and some data of IALP 2016 Shared Task: Dimensional Sentiment Analysis for Chinese Words. 
The two pickles are the vectors matched with the seed words; and they were using the Wiki latest Chinese pages articles(our version is 2016.4.11) to do the training.
And we used two approaches to train the word vector space, GloVe and Word2Vec. 
GloVe: http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
Word2Vec: https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/
There are two types codes: one is the testing codes and the other is used to output the result follow the format required by the organizer.
